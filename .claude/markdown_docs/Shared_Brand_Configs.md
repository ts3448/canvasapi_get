# Shared Brand Configs

# Shared Brand Configs API



This is how you can share Themes with other people in your account or
so you can come back to them later without having to apply them to your account

### A SharedBrandConfig object looks like:

```
{
  // The shared_brand_config identifier.
  "id": 987,
  // The id of the account it should be shared within.
  "account_id": "",
  // The md5 (since BrandConfigs are identified by MD5 and not numeric id) of the
  // BrandConfig to share.
  "brand_config_md5": "1d31002c95842f8fe16da7dfcc0d1f39",
  // The name to share this theme as
  "name": "Crimson and Gold Verson 1",
  // When this was created
  "created_at": "2012-07-13T10:55:20-06:00",
  // When this was last updated
  "updated_at": "2012-07-13T10:55:20-06:00"
}
```
