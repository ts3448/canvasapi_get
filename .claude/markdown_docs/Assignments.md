### PUT /api/v1/courses/:course\_id/assignments/bulk\_update

**Scope:** 
`url:PUT|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/bulk_update`

Update due dates and availability dates for multiple assignments in a course.

Accepts a JSON array of objects containing two keys each: `id`, the assignment id, and `all_dates`, an array of `AssignmentDate` structures containing the base and/or override dates for the assignment, as returned from the [List assignments](assignments.html#method.assignments_api.index "List assignments") endpoint with include[]=all\_dates.

This endpoint cannot create or destroy assignment overrides; any existing assignment overrides that are not referenced in the arguments will be left alone. If an override is given, any dates that are not supplied with it will be defaulted. To clear a date, specify null explicitly.

All referenced assignments will be validated before any are saved. A list of errors will be returned if any provided dates are invalid, and no changes will be saved.

The bulk update is performed in a background job, use the [Progress API](progress.html#method.progress.show "Progress API") to check its status.

#### Example Request:

#### 

```
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/1/assignments/bulk_update' \

### POST /api/v1/courses/:course\_id/assignments/overrides

**Scope:** 
`url:POST|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/overrides`

Creates the specified overrides for each assignment. Handles creation in a transaction, so all records are created or none are.

One of student\_ids, group\_id, or course\_section\_id must be present. At most one should be present; if multiple are present only the most specific (student\_ids first, then group\_id, then course\_section\_id) is used and any others are ignored.

Errors are reported in an errors attribute, an array of errors corresponding to inputs. Global errors will be reported as a single element errors array

#### Request Parameters:

| Parameter |  | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| assignment\_overrides[] | Required | AssignmentOverride | Attributes for the new assignment overrides. See [Create an assignment override](assignments.html#method.assignment_overrides.create "Create an assignment override") for available attributes |

#### Example Request:

#### 

```
curl "https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/12/assignments/overrides.json" \
     -X POST \
     -F "assignment_overrides[][assignment_id]=109" \
     -F 'assignment_overrides[][student_ids][]=8' \
     -F "assignment_overrides[][title]=foo" \
     -F "assignment_overrides[][assignment_id]=13" \

     -F "assignment_overrides[][due_at]=2012-10-08T21:00:00Z" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Returns a list of
[AssignmentOverride](assignments.html#AssignmentOverride)
objects

### PUT /api/v1/courses/:course\_id/assignments/overrides

**Scope:** 
`url:PUT|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/overrides`

Updates a list of specified overrides for each assignment. Handles overrides in a transaction, so either all updates are applied or none. See [Update an assignment override](assignments.html#method.assignment_overrides.update "Update an assignment override") for available attributes.

All current overridden values must be supplied if they are to be retained; e.g. if due\_at was overridden, but this PUT omits a value for due\_at, due\_at will no longer be overridden. If the override is adhoc and student\_ids is not supplied, the target override set is unchanged. Target override sets cannot be changed for group or section overrides.

Errors are reported in an errors attribute, an array of errors corresponding to inputs. Global errors will be reported as a single element errors array

#### Request Parameters:

| Parameter |  | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| assignment\_overrides[] | Required | AssignmentOverride | Attributes for the updated overrides. |

#### Example Request:
